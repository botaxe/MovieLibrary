# Usage
This MPA is used to document all watch movies. First off by adding popular directors that you like in the directors page, you'll be able to pair each movie or show you've watched with the corresponding director. Everytime you create a new movie entry, you'll have the opportunity to enter the title, director name, watch date, movie rating, description, and a cover photo to better display each movie. After puting in your entry, there is a search function where you can query all of you entries by title, watched time period, and movie rating. In the directors tab, you'll also be given the same search functionality of being able to view all films watched by a specific director.
